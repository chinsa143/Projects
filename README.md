**Handwritten Digits Recognition**
The Handwritten Digits Recognition Project focuses on the application of machinelearning to identify and classify handwritten digits. Typically implemented using Pythonand popular libraries such as TensorFlow or scikit-learn, Classification algorithms likeSupport Vector Machines (SVM) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are commonlyutilized.

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:- Classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of the 10 classes
representing integer values from 0 to 9.

Task3:- Compare between various models and find the classifier that works
better.


**Heart Disease Prediction**
The Heart Disease Prediction project, implemented in Python using Machine Learningalgorithms and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) demonstrates a commendable fusion oftechnology and health.

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:- Create a model predicting potential Heart Diseases in people using
Machine Learning algorithms.

Task3:-Suggestions to the Hospital to awake the predictions of heart diseases
prevent life threats.

**Cell Phone Prediction**
In the competitive mobile phone market, companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices. The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM, Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price is.

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-On the basis of the mobile Specification like Battery power, 3G enabled , wifi ,Bluetooth, Ram etc predict the Price range of the mobile.

Task 3:- Prepare the analysis report stating how model will help expanding the business by stating several factors including feature importance.


**FIFA 2020 ANALYSIS**
Employed unsupervised machine learning algorithms to cluster football players based on skills. Developed a ranking system for fifa20 players to facilitate strategic decision-making.

Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:- Explore football skills and cluster football players based on their attributes.

Task3:- Explore the data and attempt all the below asked questions in a
step by step manner:

● Prepare a rank ordered list of top 10 countries with most players. Which
countries are producing the most footballers that play at this level?

● Plot the distribution of overall rating vs. age of players. Interpret what is the
age after which a player stops improving?

● Which type of offensive players tends to get paid the most: the striker, the
right-winger, or the left-winger?
Skills applied : model optimization | clustering | unsupervised learning
